# Arveam Technologies: Technical Screening for `React Frontend Developer`

## Instructions

- I know I suggested that everyone can choose any page but now it seems unfair. So, I would like to request you all to create the homepage of the design. [Link for the design](https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/Gura-Online-Learning-ckgcd1pmt002lw401ojeivmsu/play/60293706)
- Download this basic source code and choose your design library and styling lib
- Make smaller commits, like one component or one feature per commit
- Once you are done please push your source code to your private repo and invite me to the same. My Github username is `2yk`. Repo should not be public, as this is an actual client's project.

## Requirements

- Basic use of Typescript
- All the linting test should pass, ensure it before pushing to repo by running `yarn lint`
- Right now you are free to use any styling library you like eg Material, Ant Design, Bootstrap
- Reusable functional components, not class-based components
- You are free to use `Styled component`, `SASS`, `SCSS`, `LESS`. Choose in which you are more comfortable and can make the best outcome with designs

## Bonus/Optional tasks

- I often use Ant Design, so that might give +1. I hardly use Bootstrap but it does not make any negative impact. The priority will be the most best suitable design.
- There are no mobile responsive pages, so I would like to use your creativity to create the design mobile responsive as well
- Deploy your code either on Heroku or Github pages

So wish you all good luck. Let me know if you have any queries. Looking forward to your awesome work.

## Disclaimer

- I will not use any of your code in our project. To ensure you that, this page is already designed by a professional and already up and running over [https://beta.gura.io](https://beta.gura.io)
